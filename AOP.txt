Limitation of AOP
1. Non-private methods cannot be advice
2. Only Spring Beans can be advice
3. Method a() calls b() then advice will be executed for a() but not b().
    Hence delegation is not possible

Working
1. If pointcut expression contains a class then the same pointcut is applied on sub-class as well
2. @AfterThrowing Exception type must match otherwise given advice will not work
3. @AfterReturning the return-type much match otherwise given advice will not work

Notes on @AfterThrowing advice
we can translate exception to a different type
